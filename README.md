## About

This is a collection of the various scripts, dead ends, and results we got doing the project

## Steam Rec

The "main" source code is in `steam_rec/`

Otherwise the other folders contain code ultimately used to make steam rec, but not required to actually use it.

See the report in `report.pdf` for more details. It's the meat of this project (outside of the code obviously).
